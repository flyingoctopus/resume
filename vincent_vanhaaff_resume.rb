    I am a passionate designer/developer with 5+ years commercial experience
    and 360Â° skills in the design, development and maintenance of modern,
    user centered design. I also create engaging experiences for installation and 
    video games on both the web and console, with a strong interest in performance,
    engagement, clean code, and a pension for enjoying one's day.

    Besides work, I live in Vancouver with my lady-friend and our little baby, Lord Nibbler.
    I love climbing, cycling, and good times!
